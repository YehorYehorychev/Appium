This is a powerful mobile app testing framework I built using Appium and Cucumber. It leverages BDD (Behavior Driven Development) for writing clear and maintainable tests in plain English.

Key Features:

BDD with Cucumber for easy-to-read tests
Automate native, hybrid, and web apps across iOS and Android with Appium
Leverage the robust and scalable Java language
Get Started:

This framework is ready to use! Just install all required dependencies and run tests.
